# Collectibles-Full-Stack-App

 
  ## Description

 
     This project is designed to showcase our full-stack development skills by creating an application that allows users to create and procure a collection of their favorite items. We learned a lot about creating an MVC file structure to separate concerns and make our code more readabel, building handlebars templates with dynamic html and connecting them to our controller routes, building back end routes and js that sends requests to the server and performs functionality of our elements, and setting up middleware to connect the front-end and back-end. 

     We also used a new library called imagekit.io that allows users to upload images to the website! It offers an easy to use API key for that functionality. We also used a new framework called Bootswatch, based on Bootstrap to help us with the styling!
